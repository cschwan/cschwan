# Hi :wave:, I'm Christopher!

I'm a particle physicist who solves his problems with
[C++](https://isocpp.org/), C, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) and
[GNU R](https://www.r-project.org/) -- whatever is required. Have a look at
some of my [#repositories]!
